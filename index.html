    <h1>World Wide Web</h1>
    <p>
      The web, invented in the early 90s is a large network of tons of computers that are all able to communicate with one another. Computers send requests to each other using HTTP(hypertext transfer protocol). 
    </p>
    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>
      HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), is the language used to form the structure of most pages on the internet. HTML consists of text content and the markup which affects its layout.
    </p>
    <h1>Tags and Elements</h1>
    <p>HTML documents use tags like <b>&ltb&gt</b> and <b>&ltp&gt</b> to define the layout of the content. These tags in combination with their content makeup HTML elements. Most pages are made up of many elements. Most tags have content, but some tags like <b>&ltimg&gt</b> do not contain content and are considered void. </p>
    <h1>Silly Computers</h1>
    <p>Computers, while powerful, are actually very simplistic and lack the intuition of humans. Computers only posess the ability to follow all orders literally and can therfore be very unforgiving of mistakes made in programmig.</p>
    <h1>Inline vs Block Elements</h1>
    <p>
      While inline elements, such as an image, do not affect the spacing, block elements place their content in an invisible box that can be modified.
